COSI 12B PA5

In this PA, I first created the Resort class that is the base of the whole simulation. People group first enter the resort,
and a drone will be waiting for them. The Resort class therefore should include method that creates an instance of drone 
and asks people to enter their desired stops.

Then, since people are the main information source (which contains their names and desired stop, I created a Person class
in order to save information for each person. The Person class contains a method that suggests that the person enters the 
Resort and the stop he/she requested. A get-location method is also included in case that we need to get his location after 
he exits the drone.

After that, classes such as Stop and Job are all classes that store information for the Drone class to use.

The Drone class is one of the most important class. It represents a drone instance and should be able to represent its
activity. People that entering the drone should first enter their desired stops, which will become the "jobs" of the drone.
Then, the drone will process each job one by one, and move to the stops to drop off people. Methods such as processJob 
indicates the processing of the drone. The exit method indicates that some people is dropped off. Finally, after the drone 
completed all its jobs, it will clean up all the jobs and fly back to base in order to pick up next group of 4 people. 

The client code simply creates a resort instance, two groups of person instances, stop instances, and a drone instance.
I used random number to assign each person with their desired destinations and start the simulation. The whole process
of the trip is printed along with the information of the person that exits.
